     <p>
       Once upon a midnight 
  <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this)">
    dreary
    <span class="popuptext">Sad or dull; dismal.</span>
  </span>, 
  while I pondered, weak and weary,
  <br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
      <br>&emsp;While I <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this)">nodded<span class="popuptext">To let the head fall forward when sleepy.</span>
</span>, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
  <br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
  <br>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Only this and nothing more.”
     </p>
<br>

      <p>
        &emsp;Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
  <br>And   <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this)">
    each separate dying ember wrought its ghost
    <span class="popuptext">i.e., cast a shadow.</span>
  </span> upon the floor.
      <br>&emsp;Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
      <br>&emsp;From my books 
  <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this)">
    surcease
    <span class="popuptext">Cessation or end.</span>
  </span> 
  of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
  <br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this)">Nameless here<span class="popuptext">"Here" refers to on Earth, as opposed to heaven. When the narrator says Lenore is "nameless here", he means she is dead.</span></span> for evermore.
      </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  &emsp;&emsp;And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
<br>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;“’Tis some visitor   <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this)">
    entreating
    <span class="popuptext">Asking earnestly; begging or pleading.</span>
  </span> entrance at my chamber door—
<br>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This it is and nothing more.”</p><br>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
<br>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this)">
    implore
    <span class="popuptext">To ask earnestly for something (in this case, forgiveness).</span>
  </span>;
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
<br>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
