     <p>
       Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
  <br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
      <br>&emsp;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
  <br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
  <br>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Only this and nothing more.”
     </p><br>


      <p>
        &emsp;Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
  <br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
      <br>&emsp;Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
      <br>&emsp;From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
  <br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nameless here for evermore.
      </p><br>
  
  <p>
  &emsp;&emsp;And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    &emsp;&emsp;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    &emsp;&emsp;“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This it is and nothing more.”</p><br>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
    &emsp;&emsp;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    &emsp;&emsp;And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
